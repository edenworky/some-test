17:36-17:41 Start
	Decided to write about diff graphs in Git because I'm not too big on data structures in particular but am on Git. The article is supposed to be aimed at "programming newbies", so it seems reasonable to start from what an active environment looks like (not sure what it's actually called, the place where untracked changes are tracked, staged, and commited), the anatomy of a commit by way of listing and then amending, and up to relationships between commits by way of branches, disconnected graphs and cleanup, and interactive rebases. Doing a bit of research and outlining now.

17:58-18:00 Finished outline, intro, and conclusion.
	It seems clear to me that this will have to be a rather high-level overview to fit the time and size constraints; but there is no shortage of in-depth articles on the specific topics covered, and the point of this article is a more systemic understanding anyway, so I'll rely on linking the docs. I also might need visual aids, which might have been nice to build myself, but that's out of scope. I remember finding Git visualisation tools before though, so I'll leverage those if it comes to that.

18:40-18:47 Finished first section, and allotted time.
	It occures to me that I've picked a poor topic for a 500-word article, and that I'm a far more experienced reader than I am a writer. I've already spent a bit over the full hour, and got up to 924 words, and though I laid out friendly and useful instructions building up to systemic understanding, I've barely even started describing the data structure I've set out to describe.

	I can imagine this is a common rookie mistake, and though I've failed the given task, my work so far is not without merit in informing about my skills as a technical writer. Therefore, I've elected to make a copy of the article so far, as is, to illustrate the current affair of things. Having done this, I'll continue this log and finish the article, however long it takes, for informative purposes, and perhaps even for it to be published in some capacity at some point. I know I would've valued an article of this sort when I was just starting out.

	Having done all this, I'll write a new article, probably about code generation or something (Rust macros?), and send the lot. If this all doesn't meet the task's requirements and give an accurate picture of my competence as a technical writer, I don't know what will. However, I'll have to pick this up tomorrow.

--- end of day ---

17:13 Continue work on article
18:14 Finished the second section and a bit of the third
	Also added a new section to the outline: Repo Relationships; but it should be pretty short, just a short explanation of remotes and what GitHub/Bucket/etc. do. Didn't have too much time for this today, but will hopefully finish tomorrow so I can send it all this week.

--- end of day ---

18:10 Continue work on article
-- 30 min break --
20:51-20:59 Finish for the day, also the antepenultimate section
	There was quite a bit of research for today's section, regardless I'm quite pleased with it.
	I also split the first section under some new subheaders, because I wanted them for today's section, even though I ended up not using them here. Shrug.
	Next section is a simple overview of LAN repos and then what GitHub is for, shouldn't take too long to not finish the tidbits, which themselves shouldn't take more than 3 short paragraphs at the most. I probably won't manage to send everything in by the weekend, but oh well, hopefully be done Friday.
